# Terraform_K8s_Project

A microservices-based architecture application is deployed on Kubernetes and there’s a need to create a clear IaC (Infrastructure as Code) deployment to be able to deploy the services in a fast manner.

Setup Details:

Provision the Socks Shop example microservice application – https://microservices-demo.github.io/

Task Instructions:

●  Everything needs to be deployed using an Infrastructure as Code approach.

●  In your solution please emphasize readability, maintainability, and DevOps 

●  We expect a clear way to recreate your setup and will evaluate the project decisions based on:

– Deploy pipeline
– Metrics
– Monitoring
– Logging

●  Use Prometheus as a monitoring tool

●  Use Ansible or Terraform as the configuration management tool.

●  You can use an IaaS provider of your choice.

●  The application should run on Kubernetes

Extra Project Requirements:

●  The application should run on HTTPS with a Let’s Encrypt certificate

●  Bonus points for securing the infrastructure with network perimeter security access rules

●  Bonus points if you use Ansible Vault for encrypting sensitive information
